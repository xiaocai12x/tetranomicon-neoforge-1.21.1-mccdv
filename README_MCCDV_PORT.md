# MCCDV NeoForge 1.21.1 Port Notes

This folder is the MCCDV port of Tetranomicon for Minecraft 1.21.1 / NeoForge 21.1.x.

## Build

Use Java 21:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat --no-daemon build
```

The NeoForge build file is `build-neoforge.gradle`; `settings.gradle` points Gradle to it.

## Tetra dependency

The build looks for dependencies in this order:

1. `libs/tetra-1.21.1-6.13.0.jar` and `libs/mutil-1.21.1-6.3.1.jar`
2. `../../tetra-port/tetra/build/libs/tetra-1.21.1-6.13.0.jar` and `../../tetra-port/mutil/build/libs/mutil-1.21.1-6.3.1.jar`

For GitHub Actions, either commit/copy the two jars into `libs/`, or build the local `tetra-port` projects before building this addon.

## Porting choices

- ForgeGradle was replaced with `net.neoforged.moddev`.
- `mods.toml` is excluded; `META-INF/neoforge.mods.toml` is used.
- Development-only debugging commands/tooltips were stubbed out because they depend on old Forge/Tetra internals and are not needed at runtime.
